# JavaScript

- JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language.
- The whole JavaScript executes in the "Global Execution Context".

## Execution Context

### Memory Allocation (Environment Variable)
- Executes code line by line and allocates memory for variables and functions.
- Sets the default value as `undefined` for variables and for functions sets the whole function code.

### Code (Thread of Execution)
- Executes code line by line and sets values to variables.
- For functions, it creates a new "execution context" inside the global execution context.
- The new execution context creates 2 parts: memory and code. Once its execution is complete, it finds the return keyword, which means it returns the control of execution to the upper execution context where the function was invoked.

## Call Stack

- Maintains the order of execution of "Execution Context".
- The execution of JavaScript follows the call stack. Every global execution context is put at the bottom of the stack, and once a new execution starts, it is pushed onto the stack. Once execution is complete, it will pop from the stack.
- The call stack is also known as the "Execution Context Stack," "Program Stack," "Control Stack," "Machine Stack," or "Runtime Stack."

## Hoisting

- Hoisting allows access to variables and functions before they are initialized.
- It returns `undefined` for variables and returns the whole function for functions.
- For arrow functions, it works as a variable, so it returns `undefined`.

### Example of Hoisting

```javascript
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
console.log(myFunc); // Output: [Function: myFunc]
console.log(myArrowFunc); // Output: undefined

var myVar = 10;

function myFunc() {
    console.log('This is my function.');
}

var myArrowFunc = () => {
    console.log('This is my arrow function.');
};

console.log(myVar); // Output: 10
myFunc(); // Output: This is my function.
myArrowFunc(); // Output: This is my arrow function.
