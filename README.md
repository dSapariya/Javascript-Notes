# JavaScript Execution Model

- JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language.
- The whole JavaScript executes in the "Global Execution Context".

## Execution Context

### Memory Allocation (Environment Variable)
- Executes code line by line and allocates memory for variables and functions.
- Sets the default value as `undefined` for variables and for functions sets the whole function code.

### Code (Thread of Execution)
- Executes code line by line and sets values to variables.
- For functions, it creates a new "execution context" inside the global execution context.
- The new execution context creates 2 parts: memory and code. Once its execution is complete, it finds the return keyword, which means it returns the control of execution to the upper execution context where the function was invoked.

## Call Stack

- Maintains the order of execution of "Execution Context".
- The execution of JavaScript follows the call stack. Every global execution context is put at the bottom of the stack, and once a new execution starts, it is pushed onto the stack. Once execution is complete, it will pop from the stack.
